Industries do not conform to a uniform code or legislation, causing harmful chemicals to flow into rivers and ground water, affecting the health of the populace.</p><p dir="auto">Frequently, these factories are poorly managed and lack proper safety measures. The result is toxic chemical spills that leak into the environment, causing severe harm to people and animals who live near it.</p><p dir="auto">The Indian government is pursuing stricter legislation to monitor industrial pollution. Five Measures that are being considered are monetary penalties, mandatory inspections, heavy fines for non-compliance, chemical inventory control and public scrutiny of chemical usage. The government is also creating an expert committee tasked with enforcing these measures.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39chs" dir="auto">What is the Industrial Pollution</h3><p dir="auto">Industrial Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that adversely affect human, animal, and plant health.</p><p dir="auto">Industrial pollution can be found in many different forms such as greenhouse gases, chemicals, radioactive wastes and incinerator ashes. The most common type of pollutants that industries release into the environment are gases. These gases can lead to air pollution because they cause a build-up of heat and harmful particulates in the atmosphere. Industrial pollution is very serious and should be taken seriously.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39cht" dir="auto">How Industrial Pollution Causes Harm to the Environment</h3><p dir="auto">Industrial Pollution is a common and serious environmental problem. It has not only caused considerable harm to the environment but also poses a great threat to human health.</p><p dir="auto">Industrial Pollution is caused by various factors such as dumping waste in water bodies, releasing waste in the air pollution and ground, inefficient use of energy sources and production of toxic chemicals. It can be prevented by using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power and installing technologies like gas scrubbers, particulate filters etc.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39chu" dir="auto">Types of industrial pollution in India</h3><p dir="auto">Industrial pollution is the release of chemical, biological, radioactive substances from industry into water, air or soil. It can have a negative impact on health and the environment and can cause death and illness to humans and other living organisms.</p><p dir="auto">Pollution is classified as point-source pollution or non-point-source pollution. Point-source pollution can be identified as a single source of pollutant release such as an industrial plant or pipeline release. Non-point-source pollution is released from multiple sources such as cars, agriculture, construction sites, etc. Non-point source pollutants are more difficult to identify but still affect our environment greatly.</p><p dir="auto">India has been one of the most effected by industrial pollution in recent years due to their rapid growth in industry and inadequate laws protecting them from this type of pollution, but they are finally beginning to take steps towards improvement despite the continued use of outdated, inaccurate, and flawed models.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39chv" dir="auto">Five measures to control industrial pollution in India:</h3><p dir="auto">We should not underestimate the importance of controlling industrial pollutants. Our society is facing a lot of problems due to the toxic substances that are being released into our environment. This is why it's vital that we take measures to prevent this from happening.</p><p dir="auto">Industrial pollutants cause a lot of harm to humans and the environment. They can lead to a number of diseases, which will have an impact on our lives in the future. In order to reduce their effect, we must take five measures:</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Reduce emissions from industry</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Control energy consumption</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Encourage recycling/reuse</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Monitor atmospheric pollution</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Educate people about pollution</p></li></ol><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39ch10" dir="auto">What is Industrial Air Pollution</h3><p dir="auto">Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulates, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms.</p><p dir="auto"><strong>What is Industrial Air Pollution:</strong></p><p dir="auto">Industrial air pollution is the release of chemical, particulate or biological material into the atmosphere during industrial activity.</p><p dir="auto"><strong>Types of Industrial Air Pollution:</strong></p><p dir="auto">There are many types of industrial air pollution, but they all have one thing in common. They are created when people pollute their environment with toxic substances and contaminants through activities such as manufacturing and waste disposal.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39ch11" dir="auto">How to control industrial air pollution in India</h3><p dir="auto">In India, industrial air pollution was a major problem. It has been noticed that the rate of mortality from respiratory diseases is much higher in densely populated regions. In order to curb this issue, the government had to do something about it. In December 2017, the Environment Ministry of India announced a new environment policy which will come into effect from 2020 onwards and is expected to make India one of the 10 countries with the lowest carbon footprint globally.</p><p dir="auto">The features of the new environment policy that have been most talked about is the increasing of the renewable energy targets to 175 GW by 2022, making public transport more affordable and encouraging electric two-wheeled vehicles by exempting them from taxes on purchase.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39ch12" dir="auto">Industrial Pollution Prevention Measures in Practice.</h3><p dir="auto">Industrial pollution prevention measures are not really new to the world. Most of the time, these measures are recommended by engineers or experts. Some measures may be implemented through legislation or by companies themselves. Regulations, laws, and policies for pollution prevention are not new either. However, what is new is how these now play a huge role in the protection of the environment and public health.</p><ol><li><p dir="auto">Reduce pollution from factories by changing production procedures, taking steps to improve energy efficiency, and monitoring emissions</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Reclaim urban space from pollution sources by locating sources of pollution elsewhere</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Require new factories to be constructed with pollution prevention features</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Introduce a fee for using fossil fuels</p></li><li><p dir="auto">Invest in clean technologies</p></li></ol><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffvq39ch13" dir="auto">Conclusion</h3><p dir="auto">We talked about how the government has to take the initiative to make sure that pollution in industrial areas are controlled. They should also provide incentives to industries for minimizing pollution.</p><p dir="auto">It is imperative for us, as a society, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and start investing in renewable, clean energy sources. The only way we can avoid pollution is by having stricter regulations on fossil fuel-based power plants.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 20, 2021</div><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.bibarud.com/tags/explained/">Explained</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fthe-5-measures-to-control-industrial-pollution-in-india%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.bibarud.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fthe-5-measures-to-control-industrial-pollution-in-india%2F&amp;via=Bibarud&amp;text=The%205%20Measures%20to%20Control%20Industrial%20Pollution%20in%20India" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.bibarud.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fthe-5-measures-to-control-industrial-pollution-in-india%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F31%2FThe-5-Measures-to-Control-Industrial-Pollution-in-India.jpg&amp;description=The%205%20Measures%20to%20Control%20Industrial%20Pollution%20in%20India" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION] Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.bibarud.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fthe-5-measures-to-control-industrial-pollution-in-india%2F&amp;title=The%205%20Measures%20to%20Control%20Industrial%20Pollution%20in%20India" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.bibarud.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%205%20Measures%20to%20Control%20Industrial%20Pollution%20in%20India https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bibarud.com%2Fthe-5-measures-to-control-industrial-pollution-in-india%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with Whats App" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.bibarud.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://www.bibarud.com/guide-to-fix-the-mad-max-0xc00007b-error-on-windows-10/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Guide to Fix the Mad Max 0xc00007b Error on Windows 10</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://www.bibarud.com/why-isnt-shein-express-shipping-available-in-2021-you-can-get-it-for-free/" class="inverse" rel="next">Why isn&#x27;t SHEIN express shipping available in 2021?
