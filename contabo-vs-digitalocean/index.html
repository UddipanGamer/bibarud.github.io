However, there is a difference between them that separates them from each other. Let’s take a closer look at what this difference is and when it might become useful to you.</p><p dir="auto">When we talk about cloud hosting, we’re typically referring to hosting your website in a data center in order to provide you with faster and more reliable access to your site, especially in the case of an outage, such as when your internet connection goes out.</p><p dir="auto"><a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean </a>and <a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo </a>both offer this type of hosting service among many other similar services for companies who want their websites hosted on the internet.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffdp3qtcv6" dir="auto">Comparing Pricing</h3><ul><li><p dir="auto"><a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean </a>offers a plan for $5 per month with 1 CPU and 1GB of RAM.</p></li><li><p dir="auto"><a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo </a>has a monthly fee of $6.99 in which you get a server with 4 cpu cores and 8 gigabytes of RAM.</p></li></ul><p dir="auto"><a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo’s </a>Pricing starts from $6.99/month to $299/month depending on your configuration and needs, you can choose the plans you like.</p><p dir="auto"><a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Digital ocean’s</a> pricing starts from $5/Month and can go up to $1000+/Month depending on your selection of extras and other things.</p><p dir="auto">Overall, the pricing of both of the services are good. While <a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contabo’s </a>starting price is a little bit more, but it also offers more Ram and storage on the base plan.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffdp3qtcv7" dir="auto">Comparing Performance &amp; Speed</h3><p dir="auto">Both the companies have a lot of similarities and differences. For example, both the companies provide virtual private servers, but <a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo </a>is a German company while <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean </a>is a US firm.</p><p dir="auto">The basic difference between the two is that <a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo </a>offers only few configuration of VPS with many features while <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean </a>offers many different types of VPS with varied features.

Their Servers are configured as boosted HDD meaning, SSD + HDD. In contabo both HDD and SDD are used as a hybrid manner, the OS and the other importnat things are stored on SSD but the other less important things are stored on their HDD.</p><p dir="auto">Whereas in <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean</a> the default is SSD, which means better read and write speeds. But as contabo has more ram they are both similar in terms of performance and speeds.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffdp3qtcv8" dir="auto">Compare the backup options between <a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contabo </a>vs <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">digitalocean</a></h3><p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://contabo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Contabo</a></strong></p><ul><li><p dir="auto">The monthly cost for an 100GB FTP Storge backup is $4.99</p></li><li><p dir="auto">The monthly cost for an 2TB FTP Storage backup is $39.99.</p></li></ul><p dir="auto">The <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f49f0dc5b910" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">digital ocean</a> backup price is $1 per month for the $5/month Plan.
