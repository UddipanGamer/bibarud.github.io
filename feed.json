Therefore, this is a unique yet extremely useful topic.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"4\">Because of the widespread use of browsers on our cellphones, there are virtually unlimited possibilities for what may be done and achieved using a web browser. So let's get this tutorial started by going over all there is to know about the Vizio TV Internet browser software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oee\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"4\">Can I use my Vizio Smart TV to access the internet?</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"6\">Yes! You certainly can. We all want to be able to access the internet quickly, which is feasible with web browsers. Sure, you can receive the information you need on your Smartphone, laptop, or computer and then transmit it to the TV.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"7\">However, this is not always enjoyable and takes time. Not to add, if you don't have the internet, downloading data through phone hotspots, USB connections, and other methods can be difficult. This is when the Internet browser comes in handy.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"8\">You can always try to get an Internet browser for your Vizio TV and use it to browse and download stuff directly from the television without the use of any additional devices. The next section explains how you can try to get it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/name-10.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-10-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-10-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-10-md.jpeg 768w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-10-lg.jpeg 1024w\"  alt=\"Using a web browser, Smart TVs from Vizio\" width=\"900\" height=\"470\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oef\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"8\">How do I get the Vizio TV browser app?</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"10\">Now that we've covered the fundamentals, it's time to deliver some terrible news. Vizio does not have native support for web browsers. You're probably thinking of doing it through the App Store, but it's not supported and will cause the app to crash.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"11\">If you connect your Vizio Smart TV to a computer input port or a Cat5 cable, it will support a web browser, which is very similar to casting rather than using an actual web browser.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"12\">Although the Vizio Smart TV can not access the Internet directly, it can access Netflix, Hulu, Peacock TV, and Roku, among other apps, for all of your video streaming needs. These, too, require an internet connection to function.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\">This raises a critical question. How does one connect a Vizio Smart TV to a network so that it can access the internet? You'll always need a way to connect to the internet, whether you're using an internet browser or video streaming apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oeg\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\">How to see if the internet connection on your Vizio Smart TV is working?</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/name-9-2.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-9-2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-9-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-9-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/22/responsive/name-9-2-lg.jpeg 1024w\"  alt=\"How to see if the internet connection on your Vizio Smart TV is working?\" width=\"900\" height=\"470\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oeh\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"15\">Examine Other Devices' Internet Connections</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"16\">This is a very dependable and simple way to do it. You may always connect a device to the same network as the Vizio Smart TV to see if it works well with the internet. If it still doesn't work, try turning on and off your internet connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oei\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"17\">Double-check that you're connected properly.</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"18\">If you use Wifi to connect your Vizio device to the internet, check the settings to see if your Smart TV is connected to a network (the network name and connection status should be visible if it is).</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"19\">If it isn't already linked, connect it by entering the correct password and try using the apps again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oej\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"20\">Restart your Vizio smart television</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"21\">If you are connected to the internet but it is not working, you may either pull out the power cable or just switch off and restart the TV. Rebooting almost always solves these kinds of problems, and hopefully it will for you as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oek\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"22\">Get in touch with the customer service team.</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"23\">You can contact Vizio's customer service department about these concerns and inform them that your internet is not working. Take note of the variant you have, as well as the firmware and any upgrades it is running.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"24\">Hopefully, based on your information, the Vizio support staff will be able to give you a successful solution that will work for you!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oel\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"25\">Restart your Vizio smart television</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"26\">It was a severe approach, but on the other hand, it would cure the TV of any problem it had been having that had gone undetected. This should hopefully resolve the internet problem, but remember to back up your data first.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oem\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"26\">How can I get my Vizio Smart TV to connect to the internet?</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"28\">To connect a Vizio Smart TV to the internet, there are two main options. The first is the most common wireless connection method, and the second is a cable connection approach. Both of them are simple, so pick the one that best suits your needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oen\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"29\">Using the wireless approach, connect your Vizio Smart TV.</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"31\"><strong>Step 1: </strong>On the remote, locate and press the menu button.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"32\">Each remote's design differs to some extent, but the menu button is usually found at the top of the remote, plainly labelled as MENU.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"34\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Network from the drop-down menu.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"35\">This is where you can connect to a variety of wireless networks or WiFi.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"37\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the desired WiFi network by navigating to it and clicking on it.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"38\">As the credentials, you will be requested to provide a password.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"40\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Using the on-screen keyboard, type the correct password.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"41\">That concludes our discussion. The Vizio Smart TV is now connected to the WiFi network and ready to use!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oeo\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"41\">Using the Wired option, connect your Vizio Smart TV.</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"45\">f you don't want to use the WiFi network, you can use an Ethernet cable with a slightly modified setting to get the same effect.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"47\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Plug the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the WiFi router.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"48\">A set of ports on the rear of the wifi router are used for WAN, Ethernet, and other connections. Make certain you're connected to the correct one.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"50\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Plug the other end into the TV's Ethernet port.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"51\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the Menu Button once more.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"52\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Join The New Network You've Found.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"53\">The new network discovered with the Ethernet cable will be noticeable. Select it and follow the directions to connect to it.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"55\">That's all there is to it! You can now use a wired connection to watch videos on your Vizio Smart TV!</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fbednk3oep\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"57\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"59\">The methods for connecting to the internet and using the Vizio TV internet browser software were addressed in the preceding article. I hope you found it informative.</p>",

HBO Max also gives you access to exclusive HBO series. However, a variety of obstacles may hinder you from doing so. We're going to discuss one of these issues, HBO Max's lack of sound.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"5\">Apart from that, we'd also talk about how to correct it along the road. Because HBO Max is used by several devices, you should double-check each solution. Let's get this article started right away.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"5\"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/how-to-watch-hbo-max-on-fios-tv/\">How to watch HBO Max on FiOS TV - (Guide 2021)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3ro\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"6\">How do I fix HBO Max's sound problem?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rp\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"7\">Examine the volume</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"8\">It may appear to be a ridiculous answer, but believe me when I say that you do not want to know how many times it has happened to me. I wasted precious seconds trying to download files again because I thought they were missing audio due to a bug. Check your device's audio levels to avoid making the same error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rq\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"9\">Make sure your phone is not in do not disturb mode</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"10\">The sound profiles are fantastic. On keypad phones in the past, you might have noticed different profiles, such as Silent, Meeting, Outside, and so on. The same is renamed on Android or iPhones, and one of them is DND (or Do Not Disturb in short), which is wonderful for muting your phone but disables media sound if you don't enable it.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"11\">Make sure Do Not Disturb is turned off whenever you're utilising HBO Max or any other media material, including audio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rr\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"12\">Speakers with flaws</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\">Do you have an ancient phone? Perhaps your device's speakers have finally given up the ghost. This implies you won't be able to receive clear or continuous audio from it. It's possible that you won't get any sound from it at all.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"14\">The best approach to seeing if the material has audio is to try a working pair of earbuds or headphones and plug them into the audio jack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rs\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"true\" data-paragraphid=\"15\">Bluetooth compatibility</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"16\">You would not notice if your Bluetooth was unintentionally linked to your headphones or the speakers downstairs, but you would think that the noise was not originating from the media content.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"17\">Always check your notification panel to see if anything is associated with your Bluetooth, which could be open and paired with another device in most circumstances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rt\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"true\" data-paragraphid=\"18\">Speakers should be checked</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"19\">This is computer and Smart TV advice (Samsung and Apple TVs). Always double-check your external speakers to ensure they are properly connected. Try playing another piece of material to see if it has any sounds. If it doesn't, your speaker will need to be reprogrammed.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"19\"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/what-does-the-phrase-no-couriers-nearby-on-uber-eats-mean/\">What does the phrase \"no couriers nearby\" on Uber Eats mean?

If nothing else works, try searching for a solution on the HBO Max help website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fapute3rv\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"true\" data-paragraphid=\"22\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"23\">The steps in the above advice will show you how to effortlessly cure HBO Max no sound on various devices.

Several customers have reported the same issue, with most of them citing Verizon as the source of their troubles. This article explains how to stream HBO Max on FiOS Internet service.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You'd be astonished to learn how FiOS and Verizon are connected, and you'd be even more startled to understand what the root source of this problem is. In any case, let's get right into the meat of the discussion.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1faolr13io\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What exactly is FiOS?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to Google, FiOS is an abbreviation for Fiber Optics Service, provided by Verizon as a \"bundled Internet access, telephone, and television service that operates over a fiber-optic communications network with over 5 million customers in nine U.S. states\" over a fiber-optic communications network.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, you now have a rudimentary understanding of why Verizon and FiOS are tied to one another. For this reason, only customers who have FiOS TV are experiencing this problem with HBO Max. But what exactly is the source of this problem?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/fix-for-key-mapping-in-gameloop-2021/\">Fix for key mapping in Gameloop 2021</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1faolr13ip\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">So, what exactly is the problem with HBO Max on FiOS TV?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You would expect this to function the same way it does on Roku, Apple TV, and other streaming services. Verizon, on the other hand, is not like that. The main reason for this is that the HBO Max app is not included in the setup box that they supply for their media provider, FiOS, which is the most popular option.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It does not support the HBO Max app, so there is no way to get one on this device. Some readers may find this extremely unusual, given that Verizon, in particular, has said that HBO Max is supported. However, there is a catch to this.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">HBO Max is supported on Verizon's network but not on the company's FiOS network. This means that you can acquire an HBO Max subscription through Verizon, and it will work perfectly well, but it will not work on FiOS TV because they do not have the HBO Max app available on their platform at this time.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Let's pretend you could make the app appear on FiOS TV by some mystical means. You would be able to log in and use HBO Max with relative ease in this situation. I hope you understand what I'm attempting to communicate. So, what is the solution to this problem?</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1faolr13iq\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instructions on how to stream HBO Max on FiOS TV</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes to a remedy, the only way out is to subscribe to the HBO premium channel on the setup box, which is now unavailable. You can follow Verizon's announcements on Twitter and other social media platforms, but it is unlikely that anything will happen very soon. In addition, workarounds such as casting are not permitted.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Several users claimed that casting via the HBO Max app on their smartphones had failed. As a result, there are other options, such as using services such as Amazon Firestick. A method of getting access to the HBO Max app would be made available to you if you could use the Amazon Firestick.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/what-does-the-phrase-no-couriers-nearby-on-uber-eats-mean/\">What does the phrase \"no couriers nearby\" on Uber Eats mean?

            "content_html": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>On a beach, a fair-haired boy descends several rocks toward a lagoon. He meets another boy at the lagoon who is fat, intelligent, and wears thick glasses. The fat one introduces himself as Piggy, while the fair-haired one introduces himself as Ralph. We hear through their talk that a transport jet carrying a group of English boys was shot down over the ocean during a war. On a lonely island, it slammed into a thick bush. The surviving boys were dispersed by the wreck and were unable to locate the pilot.</p>\n<p>Ralph and Piggy look around the beach, unsure what happened to the other plane passengers. They come to a giant, cream-colored conch shell, which Piggy recognizes as a homemade trumpet. He persuades Ralph to search for the other lads by blowing through the shell. The boys begin to straggle onto the beach after being summoned by the shell's blast. The oldest is roughly twelve, while the youngest is around six. A boys' choir, clad in black robes and conducted by an older kid named Jack, is among the group. They march in two parallel lines to the beach, and Jack commands them to stand at attention. The boys make fun of Piggy's features and moniker.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/the-danger-of-a-single-story-summary-in-350-words/\">The danger of a single story summary in 350 words</a></p>\n<p>The boys decide to choose a leader. The choirboys support Jack, but the rest of the boys support Ralph. Ralph receives the majority of the votes, even though Jack is interested in the position. To appease Jack, Ralph enlists the choir to act as hunters for the band of lads, with Jack, their leader. Ralph, conscious of the necessity to familiarise themselves with their new surroundings, select Jack and a choir member named Simon to explore the island, rejecting Piggy's whiny wishes to be chosen. The three explorers depart from their rendezvous point and go across the island.</p>\n<p>The lads are ecstatic at the idea of exploring the island, and they are building a bond as they play together in the jungle. They eventually make it to the end of the forest, where huge, jagged rocks jut out into steep mountains. One of the steep slopes is climbed by the guys. They can see that they are on an island with no traces of civilization from the top. The vista is breathtaking, and Ralph believes they've found their piece of land.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/grounding-for-the-metaphysics-of-morals-summary-all-chapters/\">Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals Summary (All Chapters)</a></p>\n<p>They come across a wild pig entangled in a tangle of vines as they return to the shore. Jack, the newly designated hunter, takes his knife and approaches the animal to kill it, but he hesitates, unwilling to act. The pig breaks free and flees, and Jack swears that he will not hesitate the next time he kills. The three boys journey through the deep bush for a long time before arriving near a group of boys waiting for them on the beach.</p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>",

I'm confident you have. If you haven't already, check out Tencent Gaming Buddy. Isn't this all too familiar? Gameloop, formerly known as Tencent Gaming Buddy, is now one of the most popular Android emulators. Today, we'll discuss the Gameloop key mapping fix for the year 2021.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"127\">Sure, Gameloop may lag behind other emulators (Genymotion, Virtual Box, and so on) in some areas, but you can rely on it for your gaming needs. It was made just for the purpose of playing Android games, and only that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fa3t1s5k4c\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"128\">What exactly is Gameloop?</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"129\">Gameloop is the same as Tencent Gaming Buddy, as I previously stated. It's a popular Tencent programme for playing Android games on desktops, namely Player Unknown Battlegrounds Mobile, or PUBG Mobile for short. This is a huge benefit because it allows computer gamers who don't have enough money or don't want to buy PUBG to play PUBG Mobile through this software.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"130\">The software includes buttons and settings for the majority of popular Android games, including PUBG Mobile. You don't even have to map them yourself because the procedure is completely automated and smooth.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"131\">You may, however, be perplexed. Why don't we try out some other Android emulators? You certainly could, but you wouldn't be able to play it as smoothly or readily. The majority of Android emulators are designed to accommodate as many functions as possible, which can make them slow. When playing a difficult game like PUBG Mobile, this delay increases.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"132\">To play the game, you must also map each key. However, Gameloop comes with these keys pre-mapped, so you can jump right in! However, there is a current problem that prevents users from using the F, G, and H keys. Let's have a look at what causes it and what we can do about it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://s.gameloop.fun/gameassistant/web/0b6deeae97ae8a8cfbfb1fb713ee294e.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Fix for key mapping in Gameloop 2021\" width=\"702\" height=\"410\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fa3t1s5k4d\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"133\">Fix for the key mapping in Gameloop</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"134\">After some investigation and numerous tests, I discovered that this is a probable Gameloop and PUBG Mobile malfunction. However, after some time, a straight solution from the Gameloop Discord server was discovered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fa3t1s5k4e\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"135\">The steps to resolving this problem, according to them, are as follows:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"136\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin, launch Gameloop and launch PUBG Mobile.</li>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"137\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Controls &gt; Customize from there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember that you should only use the customise tab for one movement at a time, not for driving.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"139\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Reset and Save from the menu. The Customisations option will thereafter be closed.</li>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"140\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> After you've completed the previous steps, press F11.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"141\">As a result, the game will depart full screen mode and run in window mode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"142\"><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the right side of Gameloop's panel, locate and select the Keyboard option.</li>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"143\"><strong>Step 6:</strong> All of the assigned keys will now be accessible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"144\">Ensure that the display resolution and key mapping mode are both the same.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"145\">If your resolution is 1080p, for example, your mode should be Smart 1080.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"146\"><strong>Step 7:</strong> Save after pressing Reset.</li>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"147\"><strong>Step 8:</strong> Go to the top right and select Settings, then Clean Cache twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"148\">As indicated in Gameloop's official repair, we're cleaning it twice just to be safe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"149\"><strong>Step 9:</strong> Launch PUBG Mobile after restarting Gameloop.</li>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"150\"><strong>Step 10:</strong> When prompted, pick the High Resolution Texture pack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"151\">The repair will fail if you choose a Low-Resolution texture pack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"152\"><strong>Step 11:</strong> Go back to the PUBG Mobile settings, then controls and customisations, and execute another reset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"153\">This method should simply resolve your issue, allowing you to continue playing the game without interruption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fa3t1s5k4f\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"154\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"155\" data-from-init=\"true\">The accompanying post covered many approaches to resolving Gameloop's key mapping issues.

Even though it was already widely used previous to Covid 19, the lockdown caused by Covid 19 significantly boosted the priority of these jobs by orders of magnitude. Uber Eats is an example of a service that seeks to provide food delivery to customers in their local area.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfe3\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Uber eats is a fantastic service with numerous advantages, including the following:</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfe4\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Ordering is a straightforward process.</span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You may select your meal order from any menu with a few touches and add it to your basket.

And how does one go about fixing it?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you've recently placed an Uber Eats order or scheduled one but received the phrase 'no couriers nearby,' you've probably experienced a frustrating situation that could have been avoided. The problem with this is that Uber does not always identify a suitable courier to deliver your food, which can be frustrating. As a result, you are receiving this error message.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">I believe you are already familiar with the term \"courier.\" Couriers are persons who Uber Eats have employed to bring your meal from a restaurant to you.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/windows-11-details/\">Windows 11: When it will be released, how much it will cost, and everything you need to know.</a></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Additionally, there is an additional cause for it. If the app has been experiencing glitches for any reason, your Uber Eats may display the same message to you, given that you were stranded at your location while the app experienced a fault. In either case, we are prepared to provide a solution for either of these eventualities.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfea\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">How to resolve the Uber Eats issue of no nearby courier.</span></h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfeb\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The following are the most effective methods of resolving this problem:</span></h3>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1f9s080jjej\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Move the delivery location of your food order:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are still unable to locate a courier after waiting, you can change the delivery location to a more commonplace one. These problems are frequently seen in rural areas. If you are going to a friend's house who lives in the city, for example, you might want to consider ordering the food to be delivered to them instead.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A restaurant may be located in an area where delivery drivers are in short supply. If your order cannot be delivered, consider a different restaurant that serves the same meal but is more well-known in the community. In this manner, there will almost certainly be a courier nearby who would be willing to bring your food.</span></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1f9s080jjek\"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pickup from restaurant:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1f9s0c9f2er\">Assume that most delivery drivers are either busy or on vacation, resulting in a scarcity of food delivery personnel. If this is the case, the best course of action would be to order the food for Pickup and pick it up from the restaurant yourself. You would escape all large crowds in this manner and would be able to dine comfortably in your own home at the time of your choosing.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-36.webp\" data-size=\"374x664\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-36-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"no couriers nearby on Uber Eats mean\" width=\"374\" height=\"664\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-35.webp\" data-size=\"374x664\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-35-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"no couriers nearby on Uber Eats mean\" width=\"374\" height=\"664\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-34.webp\" data-size=\"374x664\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/17/gallery/unnamed-34-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"no couriers nearby on Uber Eats mean\" width=\"374\" height=\"664\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s0c9f2es\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Other options for resolving the Uber Eats no courier nearby issue include:</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Rebooting your phone, cleaning its data and cache, and reinstalling the app are all options you could attempt in addition to the above. Always make sure that the app on your Android smartphone is up to date with the most recent version available to you. If your application is not kept up to date, it may begin to display unexpected errors like these.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This is primarily because the app is out of date and cannot correctly sync with the servers. Furthermore, updating an app ensures that you receive the most up-to-date user interface designs, security, and any other features that the company is currently offering.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/is-there-still-potential-to-earn-money-from-the-internet/\">Is there still potential to earn money from the internet in 2021?</a><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It might be beneficial if you also thought about utilising a down detector. According to your geographic location, this excellent website can track down and inform you of which websites and services are unavailable. If all else fails, consider going to the website and contacting customer service about the problem you're experiencing. They are extremely friendly and helpful, and they will go above and above to assist you.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfed\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is it possible to cancel your Uber Eats order if it takes an excessive amount of time?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yes, you have the option to cancel your Uber Eats order if your food delivery takes an excessive amount of time. If fewer couriers are available, your order may be picked up from the restaurant somewhat later than expected. This may alter your attitude toward the food or the order.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you are dissatisfied with your order or arrive much later than expected, you can cancel it by going to the Order Summary page. You may be asked for specific reasons for cancelling the order, but this will not prohibit you from doing so.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9s05mqfee\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Is it possible for Uber Eats to refund the cancellation fee?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your request for order cancellation and refund will be considered authentic or invalid, depending on its legitimacy. Consider the following scenario: you cancel your order after 30 minutes, even though the estimated delivery time was between 30-45 minutes. Even though 30 minutes is an extended period, it is still less than the estimated time.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is unlikely that Uber Eats would reimburse your cancellation fee if you were already aware of the situation and then changed your mind. Unless the delivery timeframe is acceptable to you, there is no need to order with us. If the food arrives much later than expected, you have the option to cancel the order and receive a refund. In the best-case scenario, the company would issue you a full refund, a complimentary lunch, or most likely a promo voucher for the same amount of money.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"10\">The TED Talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in July 2009 focuses on the dangers of the \"single storey\" and locates the origin of these stories. Adichie thinks that single stories start from basic misconceptions or a lack of awareness of others, but these stories may also be used maliciously to discriminate against other communities (Adichie). Even as children, people are impressionable and vulnerable to individual stories (Adichie 01:43). Adichie states that the media and literature readily available to the public tell only one story, leading to stereotypes and generalisations.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"11\">\"In particular, she explains why generalisations are made.\" Coupled with the idea that everyone from Africa comes from a poor, suffering background, her college roommate had a \"default posture\" of \"well-meaning sympathy\" towards her (04:49). Adichie also obviously blames herself for falling prey to the \"one tale\" craze, much like others. Because of the extensive media emphasis on Mexican immigration, she has absorbed the idea that all Mexicans are immigrants (Adichie 08:53). However, just one storey can not characterise a whole group of individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"12\">Political and cultural powers have an impact on storytelling as well.Story-spreading power holds ideas over time as well. \"Managing 'how stories are told, who tells them, when they're told, and how many stories are told' can be exploited for malintent\" (09:25). Adichie's journey to Mexico is a good representation of how power is often utilised to mislead people about others. And, moreover, important western stories have contributed to the marginalisation of people like Adichie, as foreigners are not part of their experiences. Adichie uses the first story she wrote to portray people of all races enjoying playing in the snow (Adichie 00:39). \"When she came across African writers, that freed her from having a singular story of what books are and from being another victim of biased literature\" (02:36).</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\">To give an overall summary, Adichie simply says that \"you portray people as one thing, as only one thing, and that is what they eventually become\" (09:25). Her conclusion asserts that propagating a variety of stories against promoting one narrative is vital. She maintains that rejecting single-story phenomena is necessary to perceive humans as more than just an incomplete idea. (Adichie 18:17).</p>",

He realised he was having a horrible day. The poet's mood shifts from bitter to delight when he touches the snow, which is cold and velvety to the touch. People of all ages and backgrounds can benefit from being outside in nature, despite its unpredictable nature. Other trees, such as oak, maple, or pine, were not preferred by Robert Frost. When it comes to poison and toxicity, hemlocks are often associated with them.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"8\"><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/the-danger-of-a-single-story-summary-in-350-words/\">The danger of a single story summary in 350 words</a></p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"9\">It is the message of this poetry that there are no trivial things in life. Our lives can be transformed by even the most simple events. It also demonstrates how, by viewing things in a positive light, we may influence the outcome of our lives. Do not doubt those small acts of kindness we perform on a daily basis, and how they can brighten someone's day and even influence their future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f9a6g0pg4h\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"9\">Dust of Snow Question &amp; Answers</h2>\n<p><strong>Q1. What exactly is \"snow dust\"?What does the poet say has changed his mood? How has the poet’s mood changed? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ans</strong>: \"Snow dust\" is made up of snowflakes. For the poet, the particles were \"dust.\" The poet was angry as particles of snow landed on him. Instantly, the poet's attitude to his own mind was altered, and his day improved.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"12\"><strong>Q 2. How does Frost present nature in this poem? The following questions may help you to think of an answer.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>(i) What are the birds that are usually named in poems? Do you think the crow is often mentioned in poems? What images come to your mind when you think of a crow?</strong></p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>Ans</strong>: The birds mentioned above can be found in a lot of the poetry.Crows are generally viewed as signs of doom and fear. They are often used for criticism.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>(ii) Again, what is \"a hemlock tree\"? Why doesn’t the poet write about a more ‘beautiful’ tree, such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?</strong></p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>Ans</strong>: Trees are viewed as great creatures that teach wisdom, as they are too old. The absorbance of all negative energy is connected to the emission of oxygen. But certain trees are poisonous, like the hemlock tree. To evoke a sorrowful atmosphere, the poet avoids mentioning more lovely trees such as maple, oak, or pine. He refers to the hemlock tree, which is deadly, as being \"poisonous\".</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>(iii) What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent — joy or sorrow? What does the dust of snow that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?</strong></p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"13\"><strong>Ans</strong>: The crow and the hemlock tree symbolise sorrow. Frost employed both crows and the hemlock tree to bring about positivity and vigour to his day. By excluding such birds and trees, the poet has endeavoured to shatter our beliefs about various types of natural agents. He has tried to convince us that we view the world as we like it to be. When a crow flies into a hemlock tree, everyone benefits. The snow dust stands for gladness.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"9\"> </p>",

According to the poet's explanation in the poem, lovely things provide enormous joy and delight. The poet also speaks about God's numerous creations, all of which we should be able to appreciate. This is due to the fact that these wonderful things give us a plethora of reasons to be joyful. Beauty, according to the poet, is a celestial tonic and an everlasting spring of nectar that never runs dry.</p>\n<p data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"4\"><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.bibarud.com/the-portrait-of-a-lady-summary-hornbill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Portrait of a Lady Summary (Hornbill)</a></p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"5\">A Thing of Beauty teaches us about the importance of beautiful things that are all around us and the importance of cherishing those things. There are a variety of species in our environment that help to keep our world alive. The forests are abundant with beautiful musk rose blossoms, and the running streams of water give a refreshing breeze throughout the hot summer months. It is also important to remember the wonderful and inspiring stories of the courageous troops who served our country. These valiant soldiers risk their lives and make the ultimate sacrifice to protect others.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"true\" data-paragraphid=\"6\">Seeing such lovely things serves as an encouragement for all of us to keep living our lives. They make life worth living. Life would be really difficult if we did not have access to these wonderful things.</p>",

It has served as the backbone of big corporations, and it is where scrappy startups have grown into household names. Windows was the platform on which the web was born and grew up. For many of us, it was the location where we wrote our first emails, played our first PC games, and wrote our very first line of computer code. Windows is the platform on which people create, interact, learn, and achieve their goals - a platform on which more than a billion people rely today.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"30\">In his keynote address, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Windows 11 is an open platform that allows developers to do whatever they want with their apps. Specifically, Nadella is referring to third-party payment systems that will help developers grow their companies with Windows 11. One of their primary attractions is the fact that there is no commission on transactions made through their payment system — something that Apple strongly opposes and feels renders the platform more vulnerable to spyware and viruses.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-1024x683-min.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-1024x683-min-xs.png 300w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-1024x683-min-sm.png 480w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-1024x683-min-md.png 768w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/MicrosoftTeams-image-1-1024x683-min-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f99oacrd1f\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"31\">The Microsoft Store has been redesigned for Windows 11.</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"32\">A new app store is being developed by Microsoft as part of the Windows 11 operating system, which is one of the most significant revelations thus far. The new Microsoft Store app has a more fluid user interface that matches the rest of Windows 11, but that isn't the most notable improvement. Several policies governing which programmes can be found on the Microsoft Storefront are being revised by the company.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"33\">App developers can now submit unpackaged Win32 applications in either.exe or MSI format to the Microsoft Store as a result of the new Microsoft Store.Microsoft does not take a portion of the revenue generated by developers that utilise their own content delivery networks and their own commerce platforms, according to the company. This will make it possible for nearly any software running on the Windows platform to be featured and discovered in the Microsoft Store by end users in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"34\">In order to demonstrate to the world that it is serious about the new Microsoft Store initiative, Microsoft says it is adding its own apps, such as Teams, Office, and Visual Studio, to the new Microsoft Store. The company says it hopes that other app developers, such as Mozilla and Adobe, will follow its lead.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"35\">Also revealed today by Microsoft is the support for Android apps such as TikTok on Windows 11 and the new Microsoft Store!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/WIN_Widgets_Light-Theme_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Widgets_Light-Theme_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-xs.png 300w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Widgets_Light-Theme_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-sm.png 480w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Widgets_Light-Theme_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-md.png 768w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Widgets_Light-Theme_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f99oacrd1g\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"36\">Windows 11 updates will be smaller and more efficient than previous versions of Windows.</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"37\">In addition, Microsoft promises that Windows 11 provides a 40 percent performance gain and that Windows updates will be lower in size and will continue to run in the background.

Navigate to Update &amp; Security, and then click on Windows Update to complete the process. By clicking on this button, you will be able to see if there have been any updates. If a feature update to Windows 11 is available, you will notice an update that says \"Feature update to Windows 11.\" Select Download and install from the drop-down menu.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1f99oacrd1i\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"40\">Requirements for Windows 11</h3>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"41\">Windows 11 is a high-end operating system, similar to Apple's macOS in terms of features. The fact that it works with a wide range of hardware is what sets it apart from macOS. There are numerous original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that ship Windows on their PCs, laptops, convertibles, and other devices. And it is for this reason that Microsoft must have a set of requirements in order for its operating system to deliver on its claims.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-xs.png 300w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-sm.png 480w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-md.png 768w ,https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/13/responsive/WIN_Teams_Integration_16x9_en-US-1-1024x576-min-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></figure>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"42\">The following are the minimum system requirements for Windows 11:</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"43\"><strong>Processor </strong>-You must have a processor or System on a Chip (SoC) with a clock speed of at least 1GHz, two cores, and a 64-bit architecture in order to run the programme. This includes, among other things, virtually all of Intel's Core, Pentium, and Evo chipsets, as well as AMD's Ryzen chipsets.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"44\"><strong>Ram-</strong>The amount of RAM available on your computer should be at least 4GB in order to run Windows 11. If your old computer only has 2GB of RAM, you will be unable to install Windows 11, and you will be forced to either purchase a new computer or physically upgrade the RAM on your existing computer.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"45\"><strong>Storage </strong>- A minimum of 64GB of available storage space is required for your PC. I believe it is a rather minor need, so most old PCs and laptops should be able to meet it.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"46\"><strong>System firmware</strong> - Your PC must be equipped with UEFI and Secure Boot in order to run Windows 11. Although identical to BIOS in appearance, UEFI serves an important function in the connection of a computer's firmware to its operating system. In computing, Secure Boot is a collection of programmes that determines whether or not your operating system is secure when it is running on a computer.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"47\"><strong>Graphics card</strong> - Windows 11, Microsoft recommends DirectX 12 compliant graphics cards that are also equipped with WDDM 2.x. Nearly all graphics cards from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD that have recently been released support DirectX 12, but you should double-check whether your PC is equipped with a compatible graphics card. Don't be concerned; you won't have to do anything to achieve this, and I'll explain more about it later.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"48\"><strong>Display </strong>-Your computer's screen must be at least 9 inches in size and have a high definition (720p) resolution. Most laptops have screens that are either 14-inch or 15.6-inch in size, and monitors are available in a variety of sizes that are all larger than 9-inch, so the display on your old PC should not be a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"49\"><strong>Internet access</strong> -In addition to downloading Windows 11 onto your computer, you will want access to the internet in order to activate it. Only Windows 10 customers who have purchased a legitimate copy of the operating system are eligible to download Windows 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f99oacrd1j\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"50\">Is it possible that Windows 11 will be made available for free?</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"51\">Windows 11 will be available for free download as well, but only to those who already have a valid copy of Windows 10 installed on their machines. Microsoft has stated that the distribution will begin somewhere in November and will continue through the end of the decade. It's possible to test Windows 11 beta versions until the final version is published if you join the Windows Insider Program, but this will need you to wait for a long time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1f99oacrd1k\" class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"52\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"root-block-node\" data-changed=\"false\" data-paragraphid=\"53\">Windows is more than simply an operating system; it's a fabric that is woven into our daily lives and our professional lives as well. There, we meet new people and study as well as work and play. It's a great place to be. It has grown known to us and has been modified to our needs over time. It's an exciting time for Windows users right now because the operating system has to be optimised on a general level.</p>",
