Today's world is full of serious cyber-threats and malware, and we know that if we don't protect our files, we will lose them.</p><p dir="auto">But with so much information out there about what tools we should be using to keep our PDFs safe, it can be hard to figure out which solution is best for you and your company. Every option has its benefits and drawbacks, and it's hard to know which one is the perfect fit for you.</p><p dir="auto">In this guide you’ll know all about protecting your PDF files:</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffcjt0181b" dir="auto">What are PDF Files?</h3><p dir="auto">PDF files are document files that provide a high quality and accurate reproduction of the original document. They are used widely in academic institutions, legal systems, and other organizations that require a permanent record of text or images without any changes.</p><p dir="auto">PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It is developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated as a subset of PostScript language for viewing text and graphics on a monitor. The PDF format is capable of not just providing access to a wide variety of fonts, colors, line art, graphics, and images but it also offers the original file's content with high effectiveness.</p><p dir="auto">Originally, the PDF file format was created by Adobe Systems as a way to easily share documents with other people who may or may not have access to the same software. The PDF file format was created to be universal, so that anyone with Adobe Acrobat Reader could open, view, and interact with these files no matter what device they were on.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffcjt0181c" dir="auto">Why You Need to Encrypt PDF Files?</h3><p dir="auto">PDF files are widely used in many organizations for their convenience, but what most people don’t know is that they are not secure. To make sure that your PDF files are safe, you need to encrypt them.</p><p dir="auto">Encrypting PDF files is a great way to protect the information in these documents from unauthorized access. And it’s not just about preventing data interception through email or file transfer protocol. It also protects data from being leaked because of hacking. Encryption can be applied to the whole document or selected text or images within a document.</p><p dir="auto">But there are some caveats with this topic - for instance, if your PDF file is too large, encryption slows down its performance and renders it unusable at all!</p><p dir="auto">If you want to safely encrypt your PDF files for storage, it's a good idea to use a PDF encryption softwares.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/27/The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/27/responsive/The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files-xs.jpg 300w, https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/27/responsive/The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files-sm.jpg 480w, https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/27/responsive/The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files-md.jpg 768w, https://www.bibarud.com/media/posts/27/responsive/The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files-lg.jpg 1024w" alt="The-Complete-Guide-to-Protecting-PDF-Files" width="6912" height="3456"></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1ffcjt0181d" dir="auto">Encryption Tools for Protecting PDFs</h3><p dir="auto">The encryption tools are in demand because of the increased awareness for security.

Password-protecting your PDF file is a method of preventing people from editing your document by making them enter a password before they can edit the file.
